# prototyping_interfaces_lab

Lab for CS6983/CS4973 Research in Human-Centered NLP (Northeastern University).

In this lab, we will be demoing and going through some tutorials that can be useful for prototying interfaces for language technologies.

## Prototyping Interfaces with Balsamiq, Figma, Gradio, and Streamlit

We will be going over the following:

* Understand the basics of Balsamiq and Figma for wireframing and UI design.
* Explore Gradio and Streamlit for building quick interactive AI prototypes.
* Learn how to integrate Hugging Face models into Gradio and Streamlit applications.

**If you want to follow along, please create an account with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).**
